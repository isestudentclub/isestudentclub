Quora further glorified BMSCE\u2019s fests, college culture and the student-friendly environment. So BMSCE was a package of things that I envisioned college to be like, minus a huge campus(laughs)","p":"riya"},{"que":"What was your mindset walking into the campus as a first-year, your expectations and fears and how did it turn out.","ans":"I was stepping into a whole new chapter of my life. Thinking back on it, I was slightly scared, moderately content and way too excited to see what these 4 years had in store for me Curious about how life would be away from home ,I was very thrilled to meet new people , make new friends, experience new things and grow as an individual. Although the \u201cnerd\u201d inside me was already worried about getting good grades and getting placed on time but this all went away in no time and college became home away from home. I never felt alienated or alone, there were friends who always had my back , who were there in all times of laughter and lows, the seniors whose experiences and advices were to live by and helped in every situation , the people who became family. I ended up making some of my best memories in the hostel.","p":"manvith"},{"que":" Clubs in a college like BMSCE which is a hub of talent are very unique and provide you with enormous opportunities. A Lot of 1st years get overwhelmed and have the fear of missing out when they don\u2019t get in. What\u2019s your take on that or any experiences related to the same?","ans":"There\u2019s no denying that our college is a hub of great talent but I\u2019ve realised that the clubs don\u2019t define you as an individual. They sure do help you grow, show you the right path but it\u2019s you and your willingness to learn at the end of the day. There\u2019s no reason for you to feel dejected if you don\u2019t make the cut, it just means there\u2019s great potential and drive for you to learn and grow. I auditioned for almost all of the clubs in my 1st year, I got into a lot of them and got rejected from a few too but through the years I have realised that only few clubs are meant for you. Getting into a club is more of an indication of you being the right fit for the club than it is of how good you are at something. The important part is how you react to your failure than how you celebrate your success.","p":"riya"},{"que":["When and how do you decide or know what to do after Btech?","So being confused is actually going to help?"],"ans":[" Firstly, there\u2019s this taboo that coding is the most important thing that would help you get a job. But as a matter of fact, there are a million other subjects and topics that people should explore and find what\u2019s perfect for them. Also, there\u2019s no perfect time for people to figure what they want to do. A few people have figured out their passions and a few are still thinking about what to do. So one should maintain their own pace and not force decisions, go with the flow and you will definitely find out what you need to do.","Yes. Personally, I never envisioned myself doing something technical. I was into content writing and I wasn\u2019t much into coding nor did I have any background in coding. But somehow, in my 2nd-year I got into the habit of coding and now I\u2019m working as a proper software developer."],"p":"manvith"},{"que":["Tell us about your experience with placements and their pressures.","You must have seen your peers divagate to higher studies or perhaps even go on the path to become pioneers or entrepreneurs instead of choosing the placement route. What is your take on it and how do you choose what is the right track for you?            "],"ans":[" I\u2019ve given a couple of interviews, some of which have been offline and some online. I prefer them offline because it helps you understand how the person on the other side is responding to you and your answers. Another major factor adding up to the pressure apart from the process could be seeing your friends getting placed before you. Also, sometimes you don\u2019t make it into your dream company which might discourage you. Summing it up, a lot of choices are to be made during this process- which companies to sit for, whether you like what they are offering and if you are the right fit for them. It is a constant battle between one\'s mind and capabilities. You need to know where you stand and duly set your expectations. Having very high expectations of yourself can also be very dangerous. Having said that, I do not condone not aiming higher, but setting your goals in line with your reality is very important.","The key is always to never give up or stop exploring until you find your proclivity. It is very essential to understand whether you like something or not. But then again, there can be two aspects to not liking something- you don\u2019t like it because you don\u2019t know it or you don\u2019t like it after knowing it and the latter would make this decision a lot easier for you. Even after you\u2019ve found your inclination, keep your options open and try out things that are out of your comfort zone."],"p":"riya"},{"que":" We\u2019ve all heard about this unseen-Event of the past called UTSAV. How important do you think it is for the students of Bmsce and give us a detail of your experience with UTSAV?","ans":"Utsav as it says is a festival for the students of BMSCE. It gives us a break from the monotonous cycle of assignments, AATs and assessments. My first UTSAV had a wonderful and nostalgic theme, The diary of a 90s kid. The college was decorated beautifully with the trees being filled with mild lighting. The theme was incorporated brilliantly. From Nokia 3310 to Mario, from DJing and dancing to the tracks of the 90s to Participating in all the events that had a nostalgic 90s touch.","p":"manvith"},{"que":"What\u2019s the best and grandest event you have experienced in UTSAV.","ans":" It would be a fashion show. It was the first time I had seen one on such a huge scale. The excitement and the grandeur for it is something I will never understand.","p":"manvith"},{"que":"How did UTSAV help you grow as an individual?","ans":"I never understood the hype UTSAV was given or why it was. But once I had witnessed it, it was a no-brainer why QUORA glorified it. UTSAV helped the introverted me come out of a social bubble. As I was already a part of some clubs, UTSAV gave me the opportunity to be a part of the organizing committees and I was also involved in the process of getting sponsors. This gave me the chance to meet and talk to new people. Four years down the lane, I\u2019m a complete contrast to the introverted person I was in my 1st year.","p":"manvith"},{"que":" Another very common concern among the students is regarding the internships and how to get one that is parallel to your set of interests and skills. What was your experience with the same?","ans":" Our college provides us with abundant internship opportunities which are not limited to the technical domain. The first internship that i bagged was in my 1st year, working as a content writer for a start-up, which I got through a club that I was a part of. After starting with competitive coding, I did a technical internship which started with me documenting and then eventually learning and moving on to writing code. The key here is to be patient and open to any new experiences that come your way. Internships provide you with a great deal of exposure to see what\u2019s out there and motivating you to push hard through this competitive world.        ","p":"riya"},{"que":"Other than academics what do you think 1st years and 2nd years must concentrate or work upon?","ans":"Talking to different people and working with them is definitely important. More than academics, it is what helps you grow as an individual. Being a part of a few clubs gave me exposure. I realised how important it was to talk to new people, it helps you see topics or things in a different dimension. More importantly, have fun with your friends, chill in your favourite spots around college, binge watch your favourite shows and, read all your favourite books, the college library has an amazing fiction and philosophy section because these 4 years are going to go by fast. On a serious note, you should try everything that you are afraid of or you want to try. If you are scared of speaking in crowd, try speaking at open mics in college. If you are afraid of heights then join the mountaineering club. If you want to learn to code then join the ISE student club. The college gives you enough opportunities, so do everything and anything you always wanted to. More importantly, don\u2019t let other people\u2019s opinions affect you.","p":"riya"}]')},168:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.r(t);var n=o(141),a=o(62),i=o(0),r=o(140),s=o.n(r),h=o(129),u=o(74),l=o(39),c=o(146),d=o(131),p=o.n(d),f=o(61),y=o(5);t.default=function(){Object(i.useEffect)((function(){"localhost"!==window.location.hostname&&f.a.analytics().logEvent("qna")}),[]);var e="Q & A with Muskan Agarwal",t=Object(i.useState)(!0),o=Object(a.a)(t,2),n=o[0],r=o[1];return Object(y.jsxs)("div",{className:"container",style:{minHeight:"95vh"},children:[Object(y.jsx)("div",{style:{paddingTop:"65px"}}),Object(y.jsx)("br",{}),Object(y.jsxs)("div",{style:{padding:"5px 20px"},children:[n?Object(y.jsx)("div",{className:"body2 typewriter largest",children:Object(y.jsx)(s.a,{options:{loop:!1,delay:50},onInit:function(t){t.typeString(e).callFunction((function(){t.stop(),r(!1)})).start()}})}):Object(y.jsx)("div",{className:"body2  largest ",children:e}),Object(y.jsx)("p",{className:"body lighttext",style:{paddingLeft:"10px"},children:"2nd Jul 21"}),Object(y.jsxs)("p",{className:"body lighttext",children:["   - ",Object(y.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.instagram.com/riiya_06/",target:"_blank",rel:"noreferrer",children:"Riya"}),", ",Object(y.jsx)("a",{target:"_blank",rel:"noreferrer",href:"https://instagram.com/_manvith_dalli_?utm_medium=copy_link",children:"Manvith"})]}),Object(y.jsx)("br",{}),n?null:Object(y.jsxs)(h.a.div,{initial:{y:"40px",opacity:0},transition:{duration:.5},animate:{y:"0px",opacity:1},className:"row align-items-center",children:[Object(y.jsx)("div",{className:"col-auto",children:Object(y.jsx)(u.a,{size:"xl",name:"Muskan Agarwal",src:"/assets/team/muskan.jpeg"})}),Object(y.jsxs)("div",{className:"col medium",children:[Object(y.jsx)("p",{className:"body lighttext",children:"ISE 2021"}),Object(y.jsx)("p",{className:"body lighttext ",children:"President ISE SC 20-21"})]})]}),Object(y.jsx)("br",{}),n?null:Object(y.jsx)(g,{})]})]})};var g=function(){var e=Object(l.d)("#280659","#abb4d1"),t=Object(l.d)("#660F56","#d8b8c1");return Object(y.jsxs)(h.a.div,{className:"body",initial:{y:"40px",opacity:0},transition:{duration:.5,delay:.5},animate:{y:"0px",opacity:1},children:["Muskan Agarwal, a 4th year ISE student ,and the previous president of the ISE Student Club is an exceptionally talented content writer and an avid coder.
