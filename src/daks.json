        "que":"As the previous HOD of the ISE department, could you tell us a little about your time here?",
        "ans":"I took charge as the HOD in January 2019, the department was already well established by then. Encouraged by the enthusiasm and talents showcased by our students, we decided to form a student community called the ISE Student Club. In order to facilitate the holistic development of the students, we took steps to conduct hands-on workshops, activities and events for the same through the club."

        "que":"How do you think the club has performed in serving its purpose?",
        "ans":"I have personally felt that the students are not industry-ready, they find it difficult to face companies with necessary technical and soft skills. With progressing time, the students have become more involved with the student community and the department, they have become more capable and confident in facing the industries. Seniors play a significant role in being the students’ mentors and guides. They share their experiences and lessons which helps the students in their journey. Yes, I feel the ISE Student Club has lived up to the expectations."

        "que":"On a more personal note, why did you pick academia over corporate?",
        "ans":"Right after completing my graduation, I was married and had two kids. Two years later, I started looking for a job and that is when I got offers from colleges to teach. During the course of teaching, I realized that I enjoyed being with the young minds and leaning about emerging technologies. I was more inclined towards programming and problem solving for which I took courses and learnt along with the students. This made me stay in the same field and not go for a corporate job."

        "que":"As you’ve been a part of BMSCE since 1996, could you tell us about the development of BMSCE over time?",
        "ans":"In 1996, immediately after joining BMSCE, I started my post-graduation. BMSCE has motivated and supported me in all walks of life, be it personal or professional. I pursued my PG degree along with teaching, owing credits to BMSCE. I’ve been a part of BMSCE for over 25 years now and I’ve seen the college infrastructure reach its heights from a two-floored building to the magnificent campus we are in at present. It feels great to see that with all the booming technologies, our college has still managed to hold a position on the top."

        "que":"You have acted as the organizing secretary for Phase shift 2021. We would love to hear you share your experience on it.",
        "ans":"Phase shift 2021 was held in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic period. The enthusiasm of the students was going through the roofs, they wanted all the events to be held offline. Considering the fragile situation at hand, we could not make that possible, so we decided to keep it in a blended mode. The students’ hard work and lively spirit along with the valuable guidance received from our chairmen, principal and vice principal made the event a great success."

    {
        "que":"How has your transition been from being a faculty to HOD and handling a more managerial role?",
        "ans":"Guidance from senior professors and support from all faculty and students in all aspects made my job easier. Every faculty in BMSCE is assigned with various roles and responsibilities in moulding students into good leaders. It is a different experience for us every time we take different roles and simultaneously, we learn from our experiences. Taking an example, a faculty of a department is not just a faculty but also a proctor or student faculty coordinator or a time table officer and so on. It’s a great experience altogether. We should try to enjoy the process instead of treating it like a job to be fulfilled. Everything that comes your way, you just have to enjoy and learn through it."

    {
        "que":"How do you encourage students to indulge themselves in extracurricular activities?",
        "ans":"Every student comes to the college with an ambition of securing a degree and a stable job but they don’t realize that the other non-academical skills are important too. Our established alumni network guides our students by sharing their experiences and training them for the required soft skills. Apart from academics, it is equally important to be a good human with traits like humbleness, empathy, politeness and positive attitude towards life. One should be open to different perspectives. A person is respected and more likely to achieve their desired goals in life if they’re virtuous and whole. "
